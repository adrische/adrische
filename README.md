I'm currently looking for somebody to be my mentor in reinforcement learning, who could point me in the right direction, answer any stupid questions I have, and have a look at my code. I'd image we could have a call once or twice per week. I'll pay by the hour. If interested, please don't hesitate to reach out. In terms of experience it's probably enough if you have implemented a paper from RL before. Looking forward to speaking to you!
