👋 Hi,

many thanks for having a look at my GitHub profile.

I'm currently looking for mentors (I'll pay by the hour)

* in [reinforcement learning](http://www.github.com/adrische/Reimplementing-PPO),

* and in **parallel programming** (OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, general operating system basics),

who could answer any stupid questions I have, point me in the right direction, and have a look at my code. I'd imagine we could have a call once or twice per week. If interested, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

In terms of experience it's probably enough if you have implemented a relevant paper before.

Looking forward to speaking to you!
